The script is being executed by the Windows Script Host (wscript.exe) and is running a VBS script from the temp directory. The user executing the script is env-admin, who is a member of the IT group and has the role of linux_admin and windows_admin. However, the script is being executed on a Windows workstation (DESKTOP-MDNNEJF) during business hours, which is not unusual for an IT administrator. What makes this alert interesting is the suspicious nature of the script being executed, including the use of the /c modifier and the execution of a VBS script from the temp directory. This warrants further investigation to determine if the script is malicious or not."

However, the logon type is 2 (interactive), which is not typical for a service process. This, combined with the fact that the user \"env-admin\" is not a typical technical account for a windows_workstation, makes this alert interesting and warrants further investigation."
